description: "WonderLust Third Thursdays is taking back the funk this month! It's been a whole year since we started this monthly shindig at the Liaison Room, and to celebrate, resident DJs The Wonder Bars are playing a LIVE SHOW at Essonite / Box Era / Wonder Bars upstairs at The Barbary at 7pm! To keep those disco house vibes going after the show, we've invited our good friends No Headphones and REBS, who you may have seen playing on the Warmdaddy's rooftop all summer long at the Soul Pickle. We can't wait to hear what these house experts have in store for us on Liaison Room's FUNKTION ONE sound system! Following that, The Wonder Bars will close out the night with their classic hybrid live DJ set."
